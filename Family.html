                                    Family is one of the most important parts of my life. It is where I learn about love, responsibility, and the meaning of togetherness. My name is <b>Muhammad Afif bin Jamaludin</b>, and I come from a small but close-knit family of six members. I have four siblings, and I am the youngest son in the family. I have one brother and two sisters, and even though we sometimes have our differences, we always support and care for one another.
                                </p>

                                <p align="justify">
                                    My father <i>Jamaludin bin Abu</i> used to work as a police officer in Shah Alam. He is now retired, but I still admire his discipline, courage, and dedication to his job. Growing up, I often heard stories from him about his experiences as a police officer, and they have taught me the value of honesty, bravery, and serving others. My mother <i>Murni binti Mhd Zain</i> was a teacher at SMK Pendamaran Jaya before she retired. She is a loving and caring person who always encourages us to do her best in everything we do. Her patience and kindness have made a big impact on my life, especially in my studies and personal growth.
                                </p>

                                <p align="justify">
                                    Being the youngest in the family has its advantages and challenges. My siblings always look out for me, and they often give me advice and guidance whenever I face problems. My brother is like a role model who inspires me to be more responsible and independent, while my two sisters are very caring and protective. Even though they sometimes treat me like the “baby” of the family, I know it comes from love.
                                </p>

                                <p align="justify">
                                    My family has played a huge role in shaping who I am today. From my father’s strength and discipline to my mother’s wisdom and love, I have learned valuable lessons that I carry with me every day. I feel grateful to have such a supportive family who is always by my side through thick and thin.
